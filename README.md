# Classification of Comcast Consumer Complaints

Data Set:

Comcast is notorious for terrible customer service and despite repeated promises to improve, they continue to fall short. Only last month (October 2016) the FCC fined them a cool $2.3 million after receiving over 1000 consumer complaints. After dealing with their customer service for hours yesterday, I wanted to find out more about others' experiences.

This repository consists of a Jupyter notebook which imports the .csv file in the data/ folder, creates labels and applies different machine learning algorithms to classify different complaint classes
